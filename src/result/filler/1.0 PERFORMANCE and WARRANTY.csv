,Beer Loss,(%),"<  0.5%, excluding changeovers",Measured after the filler and seamer related to the total beer supplied to the filler,"KHS: Beer loss can not be measured. Product rest which can remain on the tulip and which are lost in the dead angle are not measurable. Sometimes these drops are then carried off to the next open can. There are 2 possibilities what can be measured: 1. Place a container under the return gas outlet at the valve node and collect these residues, which are pulled out of the can, usually a mixture of product and rinsing water. The beer ratio can be measured via the original extract. Max. 1ml / can 2. The capper usually has 2-4 drains in the table top, also here a container can be placed in each case. In this case, in addition, belt lubricant is also derived, as well as original extract can be used to measure the loss in the capper, also 1 ml / can.",NOK
